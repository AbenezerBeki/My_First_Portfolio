            <p>I am a passionate and driven Front-End Web Developer currently enrolled in the 
            Front-End Web Application program at ALX Africa. While I am still under development,

                <h3>Front-End web development</h3>
                <p>Front-end web development is all about what you see and interact with on a website.
                     It's like building the shop window for a store. Front-end developers use code to
                      create the visual elements and user experience of a website. They make sure the 
                      website looks good on different devices (phones, laptops, tablets) and is easy 
                      to navigate.  Think of them as the artists and engineers who bring websites to life!</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a 26-year-old web development enthusiast based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  
                Currently, I'm refining my skills in the Front-End Web Application program 
                at ALX Africa, but my journey started at Zemen Bank where I gained valuable 
                experience in user-centric design and the impact technology can have.

                What Drives Me?
                
                I'm fascinated by the ability of well-crafted websites to not only look amazing 
                but also provide a seamless user experience. I find the challenge of translating
                ideas into interactive and engaging web applications incredibly rewarding.
